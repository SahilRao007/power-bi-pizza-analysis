# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis – Power BI Project

## 📌 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to analyze pizza sales data and derive actionable insights to understand business performance and customer behavior. The client required a dashboard to track **key performance indicators (KPIs)** and visualize patterns across orders, revenue, and product categories.

The KPIs defined were:

1. **Total Revenue** – Total sales amount from all orders.
2. **Average Order Value (AOV)** – Revenue divided by number of orders.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold** – Total quantity of pizzas sold.
4. **Total Orders** – Total number of customer orders.
5. **Average Pizzas per Order** – Total pizzas sold divided by total orders.

## 🛠️ Work Done

### 🔹 Data Transformation (SQL)

* Cleaned and formatted raw sales data using **SQL**, including correcting date formats with `STR_TO_DATE()`.
* Verified and validated data consistency by checking unique values and duplicates.
* Derived preliminary insights using SQL queries before visualization.

### 🔹 Data Preparation (Power BI / Power Query)

* Imported SQL-transformed data into Power BI.
* Verified **unique keys** like `pizza_id`.
* Corrected **data types** for accurate aggregation.
* Added calculated columns and transformations:

  * **Weekday column**: `FORMAT('sql_pizza_sales'[order_date], "dddd")`
  * **Measures** for KPIs, e.g.:

```DAX
Average Order Value = 
DIVIDE(
    SUMX(sql_pizza_sales, sql_pizza_sales[quantity] * sql_pizza_sales[unit_price]),
    DISTINCTCOUNT(sql_pizza_sales[order_id])
)
```

* Built multiple **visualizations and interactive filters** to analyze sales performance.
